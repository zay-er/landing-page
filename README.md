# landing-page
Landing page project as part of "the Odin Project"

The puprose of this project is to improve my ability to use flex box, and to improve my ability to problem solve.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

So I have been working on this project for a bit and I think I am going to be wrapping it up now.

I know I could probably do a better job, but it feels that I am getting diminishing returns continuing to work on this project. 

I feel as if my syntax isn't clean/accurate as well as bloated. But the website at least looks "okay".

I ran into trouble using flex-box at the begining but I feel by the time I got to the fourth container my understanding of it has expanded.

If I were to rewrite this website I think I could do it faster and a bit cleaner, but I want to look at what other people have done because I feel there is something I am missing.
